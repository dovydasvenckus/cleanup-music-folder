# cleanup-music-library
Simple python script that will move folders that do not contain music to trash bin.

## Usage
    python3 clean.py ~/Music

Flags:
  * t, --tree - prints full file tree instead of folders that will be moved to trash bin

## Dependencies
* Python3 (python2 should also work)
* [Send2Trash](https://github.com/hsoft/send2trash)

#References / Thanks
Doug Dahms - I have used his tree.py script
